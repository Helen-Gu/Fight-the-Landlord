Dealing:
Each player is dealt 17 cards. 3 cards are dealt face down, in the middle of the table.

Bidding
The bidding round establishes the player who will become the landlord.The first bidder is decided by a pre-bidding round, where each player is dealt a card. The one who is dealt the “wild card” begins the bidding.In the bidding round the players can pass, or bid one, two or three points. Every player must bid more than the previous player, or pass. If all players pass, the cards are dealt again. The player who bids the most, wins the bidding round, takes the three cards from the center and becomes the landlord. If a player bids three points, he wins the bidding round immediately. If all players pass, then the cards are dealt again and a new bidding round starts.
During a tournament, if all players pass in three consecutive bidding rounds, the player who started the bidding in the third round becomes the landlord automatically. The bid will be 1 point.Once the landlord is established, he is given the 3 cards in the middle. The other two players play against the landlord.

Playing
The landlord begins the round by playing a card combination. Every player in turn has to play a stronger combination, consisting of the same number of cards (except Bomb or Rocket), or pass. When all other players have passed, the last player begins again by playing a combination. The game finishes when one of the players is out of cards. This player is the winner.
